# Vocab Builder

"Vocab Builder" is an online dictionary designed to aid in learning English words. The primary objective of this program is to assist users in studying suggested words by allowing them to add their own words to the dictionary for practice. The app's layout is responsive, ensuring smooth adaptation to various device displays.

The program architecture consists of five distinct pages:

1. "Register" Page: A non-registered user is required to input their name, valid email, and password to log in to the application.

2. "Login" Page: A registered user enters their login and password to access the application.

3. "Dictionary" Page: Displays a table of words that an authorized user can add, edit, delete, and track progress in learning. The page features a search by keyword and filtering by word category.

4. "Recommend" Page: In this section, users can view a table of words added by other users and add desired words to their dictionary. The page includes search by keyword and filtering by word category.

5. "Training" Page: Allows users to practice learning words. The page presents tasks, an input field for answers, and progress tracking during training.

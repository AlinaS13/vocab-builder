# Vocab Builder

<!-- "Vocab Builder" represents a company application specializing in online language learning services. The primary objective of this application is to assist users in discovering and selecting an appropriate teacher to fulfill their educational requirements. The application layout is responsive, ensuring seamless adaptation to various device displays.

The application's architecture comprises three distinct pages:

1. "Homepage" Page: This section offers users an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the company's advantages and navigate to the application's central page.

2. "Teachers" Page: Within this section, users can peruse a list of available instructors for language training. The user can apply filters based on the language of instruction, student knowledge levels, and hourly lesson rates. Initially, the page displays only four instructor cards, but users can access additional cards by selecting the "Load more" button. Users also have the ability to designate instructors as "favorites" by activating the "heart" icon. Non-registered users are alerted that this function is exclusively accessible to authorized users.

3. "Favorites" Private Page: Reserved solely for registered users, this page grants them access to their compiled list of favored instructors. The styling of this page resembles that of the "Instructors" page, ensuring a cohesive user experience. -->
